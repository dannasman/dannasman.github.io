I'm a 23 years old engineering physics student from Finland. Interested in various topics related to physics and CS such as compiler design, OSDev, quantum computing and computational physics.

This blog contains topics related to my personal projects and it works as some sort of study journal.

All feedback is welcome! If you have any improvement ideas etc. just email me.
